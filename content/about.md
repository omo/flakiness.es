Hello,

This is Hajime Morrita, a programmer in San Francisco Bay Area.
I'm working at Google, contributing a Web browser called Chrome;
specifically on Blink rendering engine.
Before joining Google, I was working on some small and no-so-small Tokyo based companies on various areas.

On the Web, I'm using [omo](http://github.com/omo) on GitHub, [flakiness](https://twitter.com/flakiness) on Twitter and
[morrita](morrita@chromium.org) on Chromium land. (Apologies for the inconsistency; I was educated at the time when the online identity mattered much less.)

I maintain this [flakiness.es](http://flakiness.es/) to publish some writings.
If you can read Japanese, you might want to skim [my another blog](http://steps.dodgson.org/), which is writtern in the exotic language.

Here is the *disclaimer*: This blog does not reflect my current or previous employerâ€™s views and opinions.

And here is the *credit*: The background image in the top of the page is borrowed from [John Tann's collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/31031835@N08/8728856714/).
