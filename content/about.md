Hello,

This is Hajime Morrita, a programmer in San Francisco Bay Area.
I'm working at Google, used to write some code for a Web browser called Chrome and its rendering engine Blink.
As getting tired of C++, I've switched to a Java developer
and have been working on Android version of [Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books&hl=en) e-reader.

Before joining Google, I was working on some small and not-so-small Tokyo based companies on various areas.

On the Web, I'm using [@omo](http://github.com/omo) on GitHub and [@omo2009](https://twitter.com/omo2009) on Twitter.

I maintain this [flakiness.es](http://flakiness.es/) to publish some writings.
If you can read Japanese, you might want to skim [my another blog](http://anemone.dodgson.org/), which is written in the exotic language.

Here is a *disclaimer*: This blog does not reflect my current or previous employer's views and opinions.
And here is a *credit*: The background image on the top of the page is borrowed from [John Tann's collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/31031835@N08/8728856714/).
